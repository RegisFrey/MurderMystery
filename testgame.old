The place has its own land so there weren’t any neighboring houses- mansions. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not my house. I could never afford this.<br/>A couple of weeks back I’d been given an invitation to a house party from someone named Meera. I had never met anyone named meera so I didn’t understand why I’d been invited at all. Though the letter was addressed to me. No typos, misspellings, nada. I’d debated whether to come but overall knew I had to because there must’ve been a reason.<br/>There had to be a reason an anonymous person had called out to me. I don’t know how the found me but it was intentional.",
